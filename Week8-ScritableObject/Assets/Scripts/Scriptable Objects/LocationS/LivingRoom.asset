  description: "Livingroom: You're a furry black monster with one huge purple eye.
    You're in the living room of a 6-year-old, Kim. Try your best to catch him. That's
    what monsters do, isn't it? You hear a feebly CREAKING SOUND from your west,
    a regular DRIP, DRIP, DRIP\u2026 coming from east, and a continuous CLANGING
    SOUND from the south. "
